.. _dev_docs_state_model:

State Diagram
=============

The stateful objects Pipeline, Stage and Task undergo several state transition during the execution of a workflow. We 
document them in the following figure:

.. _dev_docs_events:

Events Recorded
===============

Following is a list of events recorded in each module (in temporal order). These events can be used to profile durations between two events
or a state and an event.
