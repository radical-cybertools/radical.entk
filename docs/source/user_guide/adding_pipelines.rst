Adding Pipelines
****************

In this section, we will take a look at how we can add more pipelines to our script from the
:ref:`Adding Stages <uguide_add_stages>` section.

.. note:: The reader is assumed to be familiar with the :ref:`PST Model <app_model>` and to have read through the
    :ref:`introduction` of Ensemble Toolkit.

.. note:: This chapter assumes that you have successfully installed Ensemble Toolkit, if not see :ref:`Installation`.

You can download the complete code discussed in this section :download:`here <../../../examples/user_guide/add_pipelines.py>`
or find it in your virtualenv under ``share/radical.entk/user_guide/scripts``.


Below, you can see the code snippet that shows how you can create a workflow with two Pipelines. You simple create more
Pipeline objects, populate them with Stages and Tasks and create the workflow as a set of two Pipelines
and assign them to the Application Manager.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/add_pipelines.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 56-61
    :dedent: 4

To keep the script shorter, we created a function that creates, populates and returns a Pipeline. The code snippet
of this function is as follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/add_pipelines.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 19-45


.. code-block:: bash

    python add_pipelines.py


Let's take a look at the complete code in the example. You can generate a more verbose output by setting the environment
variable ``RADICAL_ENTK_VERBOSE=DEBUG``.
