Ensemble of Pipelines
*********************

One of the most common execution patterns consists of mulitple concurrent Pipelines with multiple Stages where each Stage
consists of several Tasks. We call this an **Ensemble of Pipelines**. A pictorial representation of this pattern is
provided below.

   `Figure 1: Ensemble of Pipelines`


We encourage you to take a look at the Pipeline of Ensembles example on the next page and compare it with the above
pattern.

.. note:: The reader is assumed to be familiar with the :ref:`PST Model <app_model>` and to have read through the :ref:`introduction` of Ensemble Toolkit.

.. note:: This chapter assumes that you have successfully installed Ensemble Toolkit, if not see :ref:`Installation`.


In the following example, we create 10 Pipelines, each with three Stages. The Task in the first Stage creates a file. The
Task in the second Stage performs a character count on that file. The Task in the third Stage performs
a checksum on the output of the Task from the second stage.

You can download the complete code discussed in this section :download:`here <../../../examples/simple/eop.py>` or find it in
your virtualenv under ``share/radical.entk/simple/scripts``.


.. code-block:: bash

    python eop.py

Let's take a look at the complete code in the example. You can generate a more verbose output by setting the environment
variable ``RADICAL_ENTK_VERBOSE=DEBUG``.
