*********************************
Adaptive applications: Task-order
*********************************

We encourage you to take a look at the Pipeline of Ensembles example on the next page and compare it with the above
pattern.

.. note:: The reader is assumed to be familiar with the :ref:`PST Model <app_model>` and to have read through the :ref:`introduction` of Ensemble Toolkit.

.. note:: This chapter assumes that you have successfully installed Ensemble Toolkit, if not see :ref:`Installation`.


You can download the complete code discussed in this section :download:`here <../../../../examples/advanced/adapt_to.py>` or
find it in your virtualenv under ``share/radical.entk/advanced/scripts``.

For any adaptive capability within a Pipeline, we need to use the post
execution property of a Stage object. Decisions can only be performed once all
tasks of a Stage reached a final state (running tasks cannot be interrupted by
design).  The post execution property of a Stage requires a callable function
that can influence the next stages of a workflow.

.. code-block:: python

        CUR_NEW_STAGE=0
        MAX_NEW_STAGE=4

        def func_post():
            if CUR_NEW_STAGE <= MAX_NEW_STAGE:
                ...

        s = Stage()
        s.post_exec = func_post



In the following example, we create 1 Pipeline with five stages. There are 10
tasks in each Stage that each run 'sleep 30'. After a Stage is DONE (i.e. all
tasks of the Stage have completed execution), a condition is evaluated that
checks whether the current stage is less than the max number of stages in the
Pipeline. If yes, then the remaining stages are shuffled. If not, no operation
is performed.


.. code-block:: bash

    python adapt_to.py

Let's take a look at the complete code in the example. You can generate a more
verbose output by setting the environment variable
``RADICAL_ENTK_VERBOSE=DEBUG``.
