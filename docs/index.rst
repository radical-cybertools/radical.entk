RADICAL-Ensemble Toolkit
========================

The Ensemble Toolkit is a Python library for developing and executing 
large-scale ensemble-based workflows. It is being developed by the 
`RADICAL Research Group <http://radical.rutgers.edu/>`_ at Rutgers University. 
Ensemble Toolkit is released under the 
`MIT License <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_.
